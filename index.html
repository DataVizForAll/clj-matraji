      <h1>How Has Student Enrollment Changed Across Different Types of Schools in 33 different Connecticut towns from 2016 to 2022</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead"></p>

          <p>
In the following work, I will be seeking to address the question of “In each town, how do student enrollment rates vary between school types and how have they changed over time?” This question is important for many reasons, and the findings that come from addressing this question can help guide decisions made by the people in charge on some very important aspects regarding schools in Connecticut. For starters, it is important to understand the total number of students enrolled in each type of school because this can dictate how much funding certain schools get, how much resources they require, how many staff members they require, and many more key aspects of running a school. If the enrollment numbers of a certain type of school are very low, policy makers know they don’t have to divert quite as much resources or money to that certain school compared to a type of school with much larger enrollment numbers. Another reason this question is important is because it allows people to locate trends within the schooling districts that potentially may need addressing. For example, if it is noticed that a certain type of school in a certain town is losing kids drastically year over year, it may point to a systematic issue in that school type or in that town as a whole. On the other end of the spectrum, if it is noticed that a certain type of school was able to grow their enrollment steadily over the years, other school types or districts could learn from what they are doing and implement it in their own schools or towns. 
    
            
            To address this question, I originally planned on focusing on the four largest types of schools in Connecticut, those being traditional public schools, Sheff magnet schools, open choice schools, and technical schools. While there are other types of schools in Connecticut,I decided focusing on the four largest would be most relevant because there would be the most data available for these schools, and they would be more representative when discussing larger overall trends due to the larger sample size. Before breaking it down by individual school type, I decided to look at the total change in student enrollment across all four school types combined, in order to see if there were any initial trends about student enrollment that jumped out. The map below displays the percentage point change in student enrollment across the four school types from 2016 to 2022.

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
            font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
          .tg .tg-lqy6{text-align:right;vertical-align:top}

          .tg .tg-dvpl{border-color:inherit;text-align:right;vertical-align:top}
          </style>
          <table class="tg">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header A</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header B</th>
              <th class="tg-0pky">Header C</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">987</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">654</td>
              <td class="tg-lqy6">321</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
